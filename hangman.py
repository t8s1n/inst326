# Instructions
# The task is to implement a word guessing game on the model of "Hangman". The game starts with a hidden word in which
# hyphens are displayed in place of letters. The player guesses a letter, and if the letter is in the word, the word
# display is updated to reveal the letter in place. If the word does not contain the letter guessed,
# the player gets one "strike".
#
# NOTE: you do not need to implement the drawing of the hanged man, as in the childrenâ€™s game.
#
# If the player gets five strikes before all letters are revealed, the player loses. If the player is able to guess all
# letters before getting five strikes, the player wins.
#
# Requirements
# Your program should do the following:
#
# Include a function that take a word and list of letters guessed and returns a string that displays the letters guessed
# only, with hyphens in place of letters not guessed. HINT: You can loop over the letters in a word and concatenate
# a new word from letters and hyphens depending on whether a given letter is present in a list of letters guessed.
#
# Display the letters guessed so far to the user.
#
# Be able to handle user input in either uppercase or lowercase.
#
# Allow the user to quit the game by typing "quit".
